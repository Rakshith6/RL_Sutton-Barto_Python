**Comparing Temporal Difference method to Monte Carlo with batch updating: Example 6.3**

1. The TD method converges to a lower RMS error in comparison to MC method when updating using batches of episodes. 
2. Note that the alfa values were chosen based on trial and error wherein too low alfa value will lead to slow convergence and high alfa values will lead to divergence.
