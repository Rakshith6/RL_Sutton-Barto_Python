**Linear function approximation based on coarse coding to approximate a 1-D trapezoidal wave function- Example 9.3**

Demonstrating the effect of choice of feature width in coarse coding of features. 

_Results_
The feature width size only affects the initial few episodes but eventually converge approximately to the true function.
