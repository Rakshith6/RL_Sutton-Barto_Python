**Linear function approximation based on coarse coding to approximate a 1-D trapezoidal wave function- Example 9.3**

Demonstrating the effect of choice of feature width in coarse coding of features. 

_Results_

The feature width size affects the learnt value function in the initial examples. Eventually, all feature widths converge approximately to the true value function.
