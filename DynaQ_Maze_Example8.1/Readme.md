**Demosntrating the effect of planning integrated with direct RL on maze solving using Dyna-Q : Example 8.1**

_Results_

1. The 0 planning steps or direct RL is the slowest to converge to optimal steps.
2. As indicated in the book a higher number of planning steps leads to faster convergence to optimal number of steps.
